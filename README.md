##Configuration

You can tweak gulp variables, like the source and dist directories, as well
as what paths to watch when running the gulp dev task.

##Building

Before building or testing, install all the deps:

```
npm i
```

There is an npm script you can run to build:

```
npm run build
```

Or to kick off the file watcher and build as you make changes, run the dev task:

```
npm run dev
```

##Testing

There is an npm script for that too!:

```
npm test
```
